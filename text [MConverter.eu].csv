"How do you treat two-spotted spider mites on tomato plants?","Treat spider mites by physical and chemical means. Spray plants with a strong jet of water to knock off mites. Apply insecticidal soap or neem oil to thoroughly cover leaf undersides (mites live there). Use miticides or predatory mites if needed. Ensure treatments reach the undersides of leaves. Repeat applications as needed to control ongoing populations."
"How can I prevent spider mite damage in my tomato garden?","Prevent spider mites by keeping plants healthy and checking often. Mites prefer dusty, dry conditions, so increase humidity and remove dust. Encourage natural predators (ladybugs, predatory mites). Inspect plants weekly (especially underside of leaves) and wash off any mites you see. Remove weeds and debris that can harbor mites. Early detection and removal of a few mites can prevent larger outbreaks."

"What is early blight of potato?","Early blight of potato is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It commonly affects older potato foliage and thrives in warm, moist conditions."
"What are the symptoms of early blight on potatoes?","Early blight causes brown or black lesions on potato leaves, often with concentric rings (bullseye pattern). These spots first appear on older leaves and may have a yellow halo. Surrounding leaf tissue turns yellow, and leaves eventually die. Stem lesions or cankers can occur at leaf attachments. Severe infection defoliates the plant, reducing yield."
"How do you treat early blight on potato plants?","Control early blight by removing infected leaves and using fungicides. Prune out diseased foliage to lower spore levels. Apply preventive fungicides such as chlorothalonil or copper-based products on a regular schedule (especially after rain). Ensure good air circulation and water at the base (not overhead). Fungicides protect new growth but do not cure existing spots."
